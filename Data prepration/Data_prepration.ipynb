    "## AI/ML Coding Round - Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem: \n",
    "Train a LLM that can answer queries about JFrog Pipelines' [native steps](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-steps). \n",
    "When posed with a question like \"How do I upload an artifact?\" or \"What step should I use for an Xray scan?\", the model should list the appropriate native step(s) and provide an associated YAML for that step.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Requirements\n",
    "1. Data Collection: Acquire publicly available information on Native Steps from JFrog's website that contain information on native steps for building pipelines. Data that is not publicly accessible falls outside the scope of this coding challenge. (https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-steps)\n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing: Process the text to make it suitable for training. This might involve tokenization, stemming, and other NLP techniques.\n",
    "3. Model Training: Train a LLM on the (preprocessed) dataset. You can choose one of the freely available open source model like BERT or any other model available\n",
    "4. Query Handling: Implement a function that takes a user query as input and returns the appropriate native step(s) and a sample YAML configuration.\n",
    "5. YAML Generation: Implement a function that can generate a sample YAML configuration based on the identified native step(s).\n",

Consistent with JFrogâ€™s customer-centric product philosophy, Pipelines is enterprise-ready and universal.\\n### Workflow Automation\\nA pipeline is an event-driven automated workflow for executing a set of DevOps activities (CI, deployments, infrastructure provisioning, etc). It is composed of a sequence of interdependent **steps** which execute discrete functions. Steps act on **resources** , which hold the information needed to execute (files, key-value pairs, etc).\\nDevelopers can create pipelines easily with a simple declarative YAML-based language. While each step in a pipeline executes in a stateless runtime environment, Pipelines provides facilities to manage state and step outputs across the workflow so that all dependent steps can access the information they need from upstream steps in order to execute. This helps coordinate activities centrally across diverse DevOps tools and teams without custom DIY scripts.\\nWorkflows can be configured for a variety of scenarios, including:\\n  * Continuous Integration for your applications\\n  * Continuous Delivery workflows that connect all your CI/CD and DevOps activities across tools and functional silos\\n  * Automate IT Ops workflows like infrastructure provisioning, security patching, and image building\\n\\n\\n### Get up and running with JFrog Pipelines\\nIn this section, you will find information to get you started whether you are a new user or an existing user.\\n  * If you do not yet have a subscription, get started with trial subscription of the JFrog Platform on the Cloud.\\n  * If you are a new user, get started with the onboarding videos for JFrog Pipelines.Onboarding Best Practices: JFrog Pipelines\\n\\n\\n### Features\\n#### Pipelines as Code\\nDefine your automated workflow through code, using a domain specific language in a YAML file of key-value pairs that you can create and maintain with your favorite text editor.\\n#### Real Time Visibility\\nJFrog Pipelines renders your pipeline definition as an interactive diagram, helping you to see the flow of tasks and their inter-dependencies, as well as view the success record of any runs that were performed.\\n#### Universal\\nConnect your pipeline automation to your source code repositories in a version control system (such as GitHub or BitBucket) to automatically trigger execution on any new submission (commit) of a code change. Connect to other popular tools through your credentials for storage, issue-tracking, notification, orchestration and more through a library of integrations.\\n#### Native Integration with Artifactory\\nJFrog Pipelines is designed to be used with Artifactory, with built-in directives for pushing artifacts, performing builds, pushing build information, image scanning, and build promotion.\\n#### Integration with JFrog Platform\\nJFrog Pipelines is designed as an integral part of the JFrog platform, including scanning artifacts/builds through Xray, the creation and delivery of release bundles through JFrog Distribution, for a complete end-to-end SDLC pipeline from commit to production runtime.\\n#### Security First\\nFine-grained permissions and access control limit who can access workflows. Centralized, encrypted storage of credentials and keys help ensure secrets stay safe.\\n#### Enterprise-Ready\\nManage multiple execution nodes using a single installation of Pipelines and automatically distribute Pipeline execution across them for scale and speed.\\n### Watch the Screencast\\n\\n Document url for reference - https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-steps</td>\n",

Always answers only users jFrog pipline related questiions.You will say i am not sure for other general questions <</SYS>>The **DistributeReleaseBundle** native step triggers the distribution of Release Bundles to an Artifactory Edge Node. This step requires a signed release bundle and one or more distribution rules to successfully execute.Distributing Release BundlesJFrog Artifactory Edge\\n[/INST]##### YAML Schema\\nThe YAML schema for DistributeReleaseBundle native step is as follows:\\n **DistributeReleaseBundle**\\n[YAML]\\n    pipelines:\\n      - name:    <string>\\n        steps:\\n          - name: my_distribute\\n            type: DistributeReleaseBundle\\n            configuration:\\n                    #inherits all the tags from bash; \\n              dryRun: <boolean>                # optional\\n              inputResources:\\n                - name: my_releaseBundle      # one ReleaseBundle is required\\n                  trigger: false   \\n                - name: my_distributionRule   # one DistributionRule is required\\n                  trigger: false    # default true\\n              outputResources:\\n                - name: my_releaseBundleOutput # one ReleaseBundle is optional\\n     \\n            execution:\\n              onStart:\\n                - echo \"Preparing for work...\"\\n              onSuccess:\\n                - echo \"Job well done!\"\\n              onFailure:\\n                - echo \"uh oh, something went wrong\"\\n              onComplete: #always\\n                - echo \"Cleaning up some stuff\"\\n    \\n[/YAML]\\n##### Tags\\n###### name\\nAn alphanumeric string (underscores are permitted) that identifies the step.\\n###### type\\nMust be `DistributeReleaseBundle `for this step type.\\n###### configuration\\nSpecifies all configuration selections for the step's execution environment. This step inherits the Bash/ PowerShell step configuration tags, including these pertinent tags:\\nTag\\n **Description of usage**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`inputResources`\\nMust specify a ReleaseBundle resource and one DistributionRule resource.\\nRequired  \\n`outputResources`\\nMay specify a ReleaseBundle resource to be updated with the `name` and `version` of the input ReleaseBundle.\\nOptional  \\nIn addition, these tags can be defined to support the step's native operation:\\n### Tags derived from Bash\\nAll native steps derive from the Bash step. This means that all steps share the same base set of tags from Bash, while native steps have their own additional tags as well that support the step's particular function. So it's important to be familiar with the Bash step definition, since it's the core of the definition of all other steps.\\nTag\\n **Description of usage**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`dryRun`\\nControls whether this should be a dry run to test if the release bundle can distribute to the Edge nodes matching the distribution rule.\\nThe default is true.\\nOptional  \\n###### execution\\nDeclares collections of shell command sequences to perform for pre- and post-execution phases:\\nTag\\n **Description of usage**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`onStart`\\nCommands to execute in advance of the native operation\\nOptional  \\n`onSuccess`\\nCommands to execute on successful completion\\nOptional  \\n`onFailure`\\nCommands to execute on failed completion\\nOptional  \\n`onComplete`\\nCommands to execute on any completion\\nOptional  \\nThe actions performed for the `onExecute` phase are inherent to this step type and may not be overridden.\\n##### Examples\\nThe following examples show how to configure a DistributeReleaseBundle step to distribute or for a dry run.\\n###### Distribute Input Release Bundle Edge Node\\nDistributes the input release bundle to the edge nodes defined in the distribution rule.\\n  * This example requires an Artifactory Integration and a Distribution Integration.\\n  * The Pipelines DSL for this example is available in this repository in the JFrog GitHub account.\\n\\n\\n **DistributeReleaseBundle**\\n[YAML]\\n    template: true   # required for local templates\\n    valuesFilePath: ./values.yml\\n    \\n    resources:\\n      # Build info of first build to bundle\\n      -

Helps user to write jFrog pipline and answers about jFrog pipline process <</SYS>> Write a jFrog pipeline to do a pipeline-example-hello-world?[/INST] This example demonstrates how simple pipelines can be defined and executed with JFrog Pipelines. An example Pipelines DSL is used to show how to use integrations, resources, and steps to construct a simple, automated workflow.\\nThis pipeline example demonstrates the following:\\n  * Creating a GitHub Integration.\\n  * Adding a Pipeline Source.\\n  * Creating a GitRepo trigger, which will trigger a step when the contents of the source control repository change.\\n  * Using inputResources and inputSteps to set up dependencies between steps and resources.\\n  * Using environment variables (e.g. $res_myFirstRepo_commitSha) to extract information from `inputResources`.\\n  * Using run state to pass information to downstream steps of a run.\\n  * Using pipeline state to pass information to subsequent runs.\\n  * Connecting dependent pipelines through resources\\n\\n\\nSuccessful runs of the pipeline in this quickstart look like this:  \\n#### Before you Begin\\nBefore trying this quickstart, ensure that you have:\\n  * A GitHub account. This is required for forking the example repository.\\n  * A JFrog Platform Cloud account, or self-hosted JFrog Pipelines.\\n  * At least one node pool. This is the set of nodes that all pipeline steps will execute in. For more information, see Managing Pipelines Node Pools.\\n  * A user account in Artifactory with deploy permissions to at least one binary repository.\\n\\n\\n#### Running this pipeline\\nPerform the following steps to run this pipeline:\\n  1. ##### Fork repository\\nThe Pipelines DSL for this example is available in the JFrog GitHub repository repository in the JFrog GitHub account.\\nThe DSL file is a yaml file that contains the pipeline definitions. This example uses two YAML files:\\n    * `jfrog-pipelines-hello-world.yml`, which contains the declarations for the pipelines in this example\\n    * `values.yml`, which contains the values required for the `jfrog-pipelines-hello-world.yml` file.\\nFor a full breakup of all the resources, pipelines and steps used in the yml file, see the jfrog-pipelines-hello-world.yml section below. Fork this repository to your account or organization. This is important since you need admin access to repositories that are used as Pipeline Sources or GitRepo resources, in order to add webhooks to these repositories and listen for change events.\\n  2. ##### Sign in\\nSign in to JFrog Platform with your Artifactory credentials.\\n  3. ##### Add integration\\nGo to **Administration** | **Pipelines** | **Integrations** to  add one integration:\\n **GitHub Integration**: This integration is used to add the Pipeline source, as well as the GitRepo resource defined in  values.yml, to connect Github to Pipelines. Write down the GitHub integration name.\\n  4. ##### Update values.yml\\nThe pipelines configuration is available in the values.yml file. Edit this file in your fork of this repo and replace the following:\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`gitProvider`\\nProvide the name of the Github integration you added in the previous step.\\n`gitProvider: my_github`  \\n`path`\\nProvide the path to your fork of this repository.\\n`path: myuser/jfrog-pipelines-hello-world`  \\n### Note\\n **All pipeline and resource names are global across your JFrog Pipelines project.** The names of your steps and resources need to be unique within the JFrog Pipelines project.\\n  5. ##### Add pipeline source\\nThe Pipeline Source represents the git repository where our pipelines definition files are stored. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an integration, which we added in step 3.\\n    1. In your left navigation bar, go to  **Administration** |  **Pipeline** | **Pipeline Sources**. Click on Add a Pipeline Source and then choose From YAML. Follow instructions to add a Pipeline Source. This automatically adds your configuration to the platform and pipelines are created based on your YAML.\\n    2. After your pipeline source syncs successfully, navigate to  **Pipelines** | **My Pipelines**  in the left navbar to view the newly added pipeline. In this example, `my_first_pipeline` and  `my_second_pipeline` are the names of our pipeline.\\n    3. Click the name of the pipeline. This renders a real-time, interactive, diagram of the pipeline and the results of its most current run.\\n  6. ##### Execute the pipeline\\nYou can now commit to the repo to trigger your pipeline, or trigger it manually through the UI. The steps in the pipeline execute in sequence.  \\nOnce the pipeline has completed, a new run is listed.  \\nSuccessful run of the first pipeline triggers the execution of the second pipeline:  \\n\\n\\n#### jfrog-pipelines-hello-world.yml\\nThe `jfrog-pipelines-hello-world` `.yml` file is made up of resources, pipelines and steps, as shown below:\\n##### Resources\\nThis example uses the following types of resources:\\n  *  **GitRepo**\\n  *  **PropertyBag**\\n\\n\\n **GitRepo**\\nA GitReporesource is used to connect JFrog Pipelines to a source control repository. Adding it creates a webhook to the repo so that future commits will automatically create a new version with the webhook payload.\\n **Resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      - name: myFirstRepo\\n        type: GitRepo\\n        configuration:\\n          # SCM integration where the repository is located\\n          gitProvider: {{ Values.myRepo.gitProvider }}\\n          # Repository path, including org name/repo name\\n          path: {{ Values.myRepo.path }} #manishas-jfrog/jfrog-pipelines-hello-world    # replace with your repository name\\n          branches:\\n            # Specifies which branches will trigger dependent steps\\n            include: master\\n    \\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\nname\\n`myFirstRepo` is the name of the GitRepo resource pointing to the repository containing the yaml files and other source code required to build the image.\\nThis name is used to refer to the resource in steps, and must be unique across all repositories in your JFrog Pipelines environment.\\nRequired  \\n`gitProvider `\\nThe name of the GitHub Integration. Its value is retrieved from the values.yml file.\\nRequired  \\n`path `\\nThe path of the repository from the integration root. Its value is retrieved from the values.yml file.\\nRequired  \\n`branches`\\n  * `include `\\-- (optional) Regular expression to include branches from the repo\\n  * `exclude` \\-- (optional) Regular expression to exclude branches from the repo\\n\\n\\nThe `include: master` tag indicates that the GitRepo resource is listening to the master branch.\\nOptional  \\nDefining a GitReporesource acts as the trigger for the pipeline.  \\n **PropertyBag**\\nA PropertyBag resource is used to pass information from one pipeline to another, and to provide environment variables to a step in the format of a resource.\\nA PropertyBag resource can have any strings as properties, which will then be available as environment variables when the key is an input to a step. When it is an output, steps can change the values of properties or add new ones.\\n **Resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      - name: myPropertyBag\\n        type: PropertyBag\\n        configuration:\\n          commitSha: 1\\n          runID: 1          \\n    \\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\nname\\n`myPropertyBag` is the name of the PropertyBag resource, which is the metadata associated with the build in Artifactory.\\nRequired  \\n`<string>`\\nA property for the PropertyBag resource. The tag should be a valid variable name (Bash or PowerShell) for the steps where it is to be an input or output and the value a string. At least one is required, multiple properties are allowed.\\nRequired  \\n##### Pipelines\\nThis example uses two pipelines:\\n  * `my_first_pipeline` is the name of the first pipeline, consisting of 3 linear steps. The last step outputs a resource of type PropertyBag.\\n  * `my_second_pipeline` is the name of the second pipelines, which contains a single step triggered by the PropertyBag resource updated by the first pipeline\\n\\n\\n##### Steps\\nBoth `my_first_pipeline` and `my_second_pipeline` pipelines contain the following step type:\\n###### Bash\\nBashis a generic step type that enables executing any shell command. This general-purpose step can be used to execute any action that can be scripted, even with tools and services that haven't been integrated with JFrog Pipelines. This is the most versatile of the steps while taking full advantage of what the lifecycle offers.\\nIn our example:\\n  * `p1_s1`, `p1_s2`, `p1_s3` are the names of the Bash steps in the `my_first_pipeline` pipeline.\\n  * `p2_s1` is the name of the Bash step in the `my_second_pipeline` pipeline.\\n\\n\\nThe steps are defined so that they execute in an interdependent sequence. This means that each step's execution is triggered by the successful completion of a prior, prerequisite step (or steps). In our example, step 1's (p1_s1) completion triggers the execution of step 2 (p1_s2), completion of step 2 triggers execution of step 3 (p1_s3), and so on until all steps in the pipeline are executed.\\n **Steps**\\n[YAML]\\n    pipelines:\\n      - name: my_first_pipeline\\n        steps:\\n          - name: p1_s1\\n            type: Bash\\n            configuration:\\n              inputResources:\\n                # Sets up step to be triggered when there are commit events to myFirstRepo\\n                - name: myFirstRepo\\n            execution:\\n              onExecute:\\n                # Data from input resources is available as env variables in the step\\n                - echo $res_myFirstRepo_commitSha\\n                # The next two commands add variables to run state, which is available to all downstream steps in this run\\n                \\n                - add_run_variables current_runid=$run_id\\n                - add_run_variables commitSha=$res_myFirstRepo_commitSha\\n                # This variable is written to pipeline state in p1_s3.\\n                # So this will be empty during first run and will be set to prior run number in subsequent runs\\n                \\n                - echo \"Previous run ID is $prev_runid\"\\n    \\n          - name: p1_s2\\n            type: Bash\\n            configuration:\\n              inputSteps:\\n                - name: p1_s1\\n            execution:\\n              onExecute:\\n                # Demonstrates the availability of an env variable written to run state during p1_s1\\n                - echo $current_runid\\n    \\n          - name: p1_s3\\n            type: Bash\\n            configuration:\\n              inputSteps:\\n                - name: p1_s2\\n              outputResources:\\n                - name: myPropertyBag\\n            execution:\\n              onExecute:\\n                - echo $current_runid\\n                # Writes current run number to pipeline state\\n                - add_pipeline_variables prev_runid=$run_id\\n                # Uses an utility function to update the output resource with the commitSha that triggered this run\\n                # Dependent pipelines can be configured to trigger when this resource is updated\\n                \\n                - write_output myPropertyBag commitSha=$commitSha runID=$current_runid\\n    \\n      - name: my_second_pipeline\\n        steps:\\n          - name: p2_s1\\n            type: Bash\\n            configuration:\\n              inputResources:\\n                # Sets up step to be triggered when myPropertyBag is updated\\n                - name: myPropertyBag\\n            execution:\\n              onExecute:\\n                # Retrieves the commitSha from input resource\\n                - echo \"CommitSha is $res_myPropertyBag_commitSha\"         \\n[/YAML]\\n**configuration**\\nSpecifies all optional configuration selections for the step's execution environment.\\nTag\\n **Description of usage**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`inputResources`\\nA collection of named resources that will be used by a step as inputs.\\nIn this example:\\n  * Step `p1_s1`, in the first pipeline, is triggered when there are commit events to `myFirstRepo`, which is the name of the GitRepo resource.\\n  * Step `p2_s1`, in the second pipeline, is triggered when the `myPropertyBag` resource is updated.\\n\\n\\nOptional  \\n`inputSteps`\\nA collection of named steps whose completion will trigger execution of this step.\\nIn this example:\\n  * Completion of step p1_s1 triggers the execution of step p1_s2.\\nand\\n  * Completion of step p1_s2 triggers the execution of step p1_s3.\\n\\n\\nOptional  \\n`outputResources`\\nA collection of named resources that will be generated or changed by a step.\\nOptional  \\n **execution**\\nDeclare sets of shell command sequences to perform for different execution phases:\\nTag\\n **Description of usage**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`onExecute`\\nMain commands to execute for the step\\nOptional  \\n\\n Document url for reference - https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-steps</s>\n",
       "7      <s>[INST]<<SYS>> You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Helps user to write jFrog pipline and answers about jFrog pipline process <</SYS>> Write a jFrog pipeline to do a pipeline-example-docker-build-and-push?[/INST] This pipeline demonstrates the definition of a pipeline that builds a single Docker Image and pushes it to Artifactory, and then publishes BuildInfo. An example Pipelines DSL is used to show how to use integrations, resources, and steps to construct a simple, automated workflow.\\nThis pipeline demonstrates the following:\\n  * Creating a GitHub and Artifactory Integration.\\n  * Adding a Pipeline Source.\\n  * Creating a GitRepo trigger, which triggers a step when the contents of the source control repository changes.\\n  * Using an Image resource to add a reference to a Docker image to your pipeline.\\n  * Using DockerBuild and DockerPush native steps to build and push a docker image.\\n  * Using the PublishBuildInfo native step to publish a BuildInfo to Artifactory, and the PromoteBuild native step to promote a BuildInfo.\\n  * Using inputResources and inputSteps to set up dependencies between steps and resources.\\n  * Using outputResources.\\n\\n\\n### See it Live!\\nClick here to see this quickstart in action.\\nA successful run of the pipeline in this quickstart looks like this:  \\n#### Tutorial Video\\n#### Before You Begin\\nBefore trying this quickstart, ensure that you have:\\n  * A GitHub account. This is required for forking the example repository.\\n  * A JFrog Platform account, or self-hosted JFrog Pipelines.\\n  * A user account in Artifactory with deploy permissions to at least one binary repository.\\n  * Create a local Docker repository to set up Artifactory as a Docker Registry.Docker RegistryDocker Registry\\n  * At least one node pool. This is the set of nodes that all pipeline steps will execute in. For more information, see Managing Pipelines Node Pools.\\n\\n\\n#### Running This Example\\nPerform the steps below to build and push your Docker image:\\n  1.  **Fork the Repository**\\nThe Pipelines DSL for this example is available in the jfrog-pipelines-docker-sample repository in the JFrog GitHub account.\\nThe DSL file is a yaml file that contains the pipeline definitions. The example uses a single YAML file, `pipelines.yml`. This file contains the declarations for all resources and workflow steps. For a full breakup of all the resources, pipelines and steps used in the yml file, see the pipelines.ymlsection below.\\nFork this repository to your account or organization. This is important since you need admin access to repositories that are used as Pipeline Sources or GitRepo resources, in order to add webhooks to these repositories and listen for change events.\\n  2.  **Sign in to Artifactory**\\nSign in to JFrog Platform with your Artifactory credentials.\\n  3.  **Add Integrations**\\n    1. Go to **Administration** **| Pipelines | Integrations** to  add two integrations:\\n      *  **GitHub Integration**: This integration is used to add the Pipeline source, as well as the GitRepo resource defined in  pipelines.yml.\\n      *  **Artifactory Integration** : This integration is used to authenticate with Artifactory to push the Docker image to the `docker-local` repository in Artifactory.\\n    2. Write down the names of both GitHub and Artifactory integrations as these are required for the next step. Ensure that the names are unique and easy to remember.\\n  4.  **Update pipelines.yml file**\\nThe pipelines configuration is available in the **pipelines.yml** file. Edit this file in your fork of the Git repo and replace the following:\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`gitProvider`\\nProvide the name of the Github integration you added in the previous step.\\n`gitProvider: my_github`  \\n`path`\\nProvide the path to your fork of this repository.\\n`path: myuser/repo-name`  \\n`registry`\\nProvide the the name of the Artifactory integration you added in the previous step.\\n`registry: art`  \\n`imageName`\\nProvide your Docker image path and name.\\n`docker.artprod.mycompany.com` `/docker_local/dbp`\\nWhere, docker.artprod.mycompany.com`/docker_local` is the image path and `dbp` is the image name.  \\n`sourceArtifactory`\\nProvide your Artifactory integration.\\n`sourceArtifactory: art`  \\n### Note\\n **All pipeline definitions are global across JFrog Pipelines within a Project.** The names of your pipelines and resources need to be unique within the Project in JFrog Pipelines.\\n  5.  **Add Pipeline Sources**\\nThe **Pipeline Source** represents the Git repo where our Pipelines definition files are stored. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an integration, which we added in the previous step.\\nFollow instructions to add a Pipeline Source and point it to the `pipelines.yml` in your fork of the repo. This automatically adds your configuration to the platform and a pipeline is created based on your YAML. The `pipelines.yml` file is parsed and resources, steps, and pipelines are added as configured.\\nAfter your pipeline source syncs successfully, navigate to **Pipelines | My Pipelines** in the left navbar to view the newly added pipeline. In this example,`pipeline_dbp` is the name of our pipeline.  \\nClick the name of the pipeline. Thisrenders a real-time, interactive, diagram of the pipeline and the results of its most current run.\\n  6.  **Execute the Pipeline**\\nYou can trigger the pipeline by committing a change to your Git repository, or by manually triggering it through the UI. The steps in the pipeline execute in sequence. Multiple steps can execute in parallel if the node pool has multiple build nodes available.  \\nOnce the pipeline has completed, a new run is listed.  \\n\\n\\n#### pipelines.yml\\nThe `pipelines.yml` file is made up of resources, pipelines and steps, as shown below:\\n##### Resources\\nThis example uses the following types of resources:\\n  *  **GitRepo**\\n  *  **Image**\\n  *  **BuildInfo**\\n\\n\\n **GitRepo**\\nA GitRepo resource is used to connect JFrog Pipelines to a source control repository. Adding it creates a webhook to the repo so that future commits will automatically create a new version with the webhook payload.\\n **resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      - name: dbp_repo\\n        type: GitRepo\\n        configuration:\\n          gitProvider: my_github                       # <-- replace with your integration\\n          path: jfrog/jfrog-pipelines-docker-sample    # <-- replace with your repository name\\n          branches:\\n            include: master\\n    \\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\nname\\n`dbp_repo` is the name of the GitRepo resource pointing to the repository containing the Dockerfile and other source code required to build the image.\\nThis name is used to refer to the resource in steps, and must be unique across all repositories in your JFrog Pipelines environment.\\nRequired  \\n`gitProvider `\\nThe name of the GitHub Integration.\\nRequired  \\n`path `\\nThe path of the repository from the integration root.\\nRequired  \\n`branches`\\n  * `include `\\-- (optional) Regular expression to include branches from the repo\\n  * `exclude`\\-- (optional) Regular expression to exclude branches from the repo\\n\\n\\nThe `include: master` tag indicates that the GitRepo resource is listening to the master branch.\\nOptional  \\n **Image**\\nAn Image resource is used to add a reference to a Docker image to your pipeline. An Image resource can be used as both input and output. Steps like DockerBuild will generate it as an output and steps like DockerPublish will use it as input to publish to a Docker registry. In our example, it is used as an outputResource for the DockerPush step.\\n **resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      - name: dbp_image\\n        type: Image\\n        configuration:\\n          registry: art                                # <-- replace with your artifactory integration\\n          sourceRepository: docker_local               # <-- required if registry is Artifactory\\n          imageName: docker.artprod.mycompany.com/docker_local/dbp  # < -- replace with your image path and name\\n          imageTag: latest\\n          autoPull: true\\n    \\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\n`name`\\n`dbp_image` is the name that identifies the resource.\\nRequired  \\n`registry`\\n`art` is the name of a  Docker Registry Integration.\\nRequired  \\n`sourceRepository `\\n`docker_local` is the name of the repository in Artifactory to which the images will be published.\\nRequired if registry is in JFrog Artifactory  \\n`imageName`\\nThe file path of the Docker image, of the form imageRepo/imageName.\\nRequired  \\n`imageTag`\\nThe version tag of the initial version of the Docker image.\\nRequired  \\n`autoPull `\\nWhen **true** , the image is automatically pulled to the machine running the step.\\nDefaults to **false**.\\nOptional  \\n **BuildInfo**\\nBuildInfo is automatically created when the DockerBuild step is used to generate packages.

Helps user to write jFrog pipline and answers about jFrog pipline process <</SYS>> Write a jFrog pipeline to do a pipeline-example-release-to-edge-node?[/INST] This pipeline demonstrates the definition of a simple pipeline that creates and signs a release bundle, and distributes it to an Artifactory edge node. An example Pipelines DSL is used to show how to use integrations, resources, and steps to construct a simple, automated workflow. The pipeline is triggered by any change in any of the BuildInfo resources used to create the release bundle.\\nThis pipeline demonstrates the following:\\n  * Creating a GitHub Integration, Artifactory Integration, and Distribution Integration.GitHub Integration\\n  * Adding a Pipeline Source.Add a Pipeline Source\\n  * Signing the release bundle using the SignReleaseBundle native step.\\n  * Distributing the release bundle to an edge node using the DistributeReleaseBundle native step.\\n\\n\\nThis pipeline starts from where the Pipeline Example: Docker Build and Push left off. While that pipeline built and pushed a Docker build, this pipeline takes the Buildinfo from that example and creates the release bundle and distributes it to an edge node.\\nA successful run of the pipeline in this quickstart looks like this:  \\n#### Before you Begin\\nBefore trying this quickstart, ensure that you have:\\n  * A GitHub account. This is required for forking the example repository.\\n  * A JFrog Platform account.\\n  * Set up Artifactory as a Docker registry. For more information, see  Getting Started with Artifactory as a Docker Registry and Docker Registry.Getting Started with Artifactory as a Docker RegistryDocker Registry\\n  * Installed and configured JFrog Distribution.\\n  * Generated, uploaded, and deployed GPG Keys for JFrog Distribution.GPG Signing\\n  * At least one Pipelines node pool. This is the set of nodes that all pipeline steps will execute in. For more information, see Managing Pipelines Node Pools.\\n  * Successfully run the Docker Build and Push pipeline.\\n\\n\\n#### Running This Example  \\nPerform the steps below to run this pipeline:\\n  1.  **Sign in**\\nSign in to JFrog Platform with your Artifactory credentials.\\n  2. Add Integrations\\n    1. Go to **Application | Pipelines | Integrations** to add these integrations:\\n      *  **GitHub Integration GitHub Integration**: This integration is used to add the Pipeline source.\\n`myGithub`is the name of the GitHub integration used in this example.\\n      *  **Distribution Integration** : This integration connects your JFrog Pipeline Automation platform to a Distribution instance.\\n`myDist` is the name of the Distribution integration used in this example.\\n      *  **Artifactory Integration** : This integration is used to authenticate with Artifactory to to get artifacts including Docker images, and maintain build information.\\n`myArtifactory` is the name of Artifactory integration used in this example.\\n    2. Write down the names of the Artifactory and Distribution integrations as these are required for the next step. Ensure that the names are unique and easy to remember.\\n  3.  **Fork GitHub repository**\\nThe Pipelines DSL for this example is available in the jfrog-pipelines-cd-sample repository in the JFrog GitHub account.\\nThe DSL file is a yaml file that contains the pipeline definitions. The example uses two YAML files, `pipelines.yml` and `values.yml`. The pipelines.yml file contains the declarations for all resources and workflow steps. The `values.yml` file contains the values required for the `pipelines.yml` file. For a full breakup of all the resources, pipelines and steps used in the yml file, see the pipelines.ymlsection below.\\nFork this repository to your account or organization. This is important since you need admin access to repositories that are used as Pipeline Sources or GitRepo resources, which is required to add webhooks to these repositories and listen for change events.\\n  4.  **Update values.yml**\\nThe pipelines configuration is available in the **values.yml** file. If required, edit this file in your fork of this repo and replace the following:\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`gitProvider`\\nProvide the name of the Github integration you added in the previous step.\\n`gitProvider: myGithub`  \\n`sourceArtifactory`\\nProvide your Artifactory integration.\\n`sourceArtifactory: myArtifactory`  \\n`sourceDistribution`\\nProvide your Distribution integration.\\n` sourceDistribution:` ` myDist`  \\n### Note\\n **All pipeline names are global across your JFrog Pipelines**. The names of your pipelines and resources need to be unique within JFrog Pipelines.\\n  5.  **Add Pipeline Source**\\nThe **Pipeline Source** represents the Git repo where our Pipelines definition files are stored. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an integration, which was added in the previous step.\\n    1. In your left navigation bar, go to Administration | Pipelines | Pipeline Sources. Click on Add a Pipeline Source and then choose From YAML. Follow instructions to add a Pipeline Source.\\n    2. After your Pipeline Source syncs successfully, navigate to **Pipelines** | **My Pipelines** in the left navbar to see the newly added pipeline. In this example, `cd_` `demo_release_mgmt`is the name of our pipeline.\\n    3. Click the name of the pipeline. This renders a real-time, interactive diagram of the pipeline and the results of its most current run.  \\n  6.  **Execute the pipeline**\\nYou can now commit to the repo to trigger your pipeline, or trigger it manually through the UI. The steps in the pipeline execute in sequence. Multiple steps can execute in parallel if the node pool has multiple build nodes available.  \\n\\n\\n#### pipelines.yml\\nThe `pipelines.yml` file is made up of resources, pipelines and steps, as shown below:\\n##### Resources\\nThis example uses the following types of resources:\\n  * BuildInfo\\n  * ReleaseBundle\\n  * DistributionRule\\n\\n\\n **BuildInfo**\\nA `BuildInfo` resource is the metadata associated with a build in Artifactory.\\nJFrog Pipelines automatically creates BuildInfo when any of the Build steps like MvnBuild, NpmBuild, GradleBuild, or DockerBuild are used to generate packages. BuildInfo is published to Artifactory through the PublishBuildInfo step, by setting a flag in Build steps or by providing that resource in steps like NpmPublish, GoPublishModule, GoPublishBinary, and DockerPush.\\n **resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      # Build info of build to bundle\\n      - name: gosvc_promoted_build_info\\n        type: BuildInfo\\n        configuration:\\n          sourceArtifactory: {{ .Values.artifactoryIntegration }}\\n          buildName: dbp_build\\n          buildNumber: 1  \\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\nname\\n`gosvc_promoted_build_info` is the name of the `BuildInfo` resource, which is the metadata associated with the build in Artifactory.\\nThis name is used to refer to the resource in steps, and must be unique across all repositories in your JFrog Pipelines environment.\\nRequired  \\nsourceArtifactory\\n`myArtifactory` is the name of the Artifactory Integration.\\nRequired  \\nbuildName\\n`dbp_build` is the name of the build to associate with the BuildInfo.\\n### Note\\n`dbp_build` is the name of the Docker build and push pipeline.\\nOptional  \\nbuildNumber\\nThe number of the build to associate with the BuildInfo.\\nOptional  \\n**ReleaseBundle**\\nA `ReleaseBundle`resource specifies a set of artifacts in Artifactory that are distributed to Artifactory Edge nodes as a JFrog Distribution Release Bundle.Distributing Release Bundles\\nThis resource can be used with CreateReleaseBundle or DistributeReleaseBundle.

honest assistant. Helps user to write jFrog pipline and answers about jFrog pipline process <</SYS>> Write a jFrog pipeline to do a pipeline-example-go-build?[/INST] This pipeline demonstrates the definition of a simple pipeline that builds a Go (GoLang) application and Go module. It shows through an example of Pipelines DSL and shows how to use integrations, resources, and steps to construct a simple, automated workflow.\\nThe pipeline performs the following sequence of tasks:\\n  * Build a Go \"Hello World\" application using the GoBuild native step\\n  * Publish the completed Go binary to Artifactory using the GoPublishBinary native step\\n  * Publish the build info to Artifactory using the PublishBuildInfo native step\\n\\n\\n### See it Live!\\nClick here to see this quickstart in action.\\nA successful run of the pipeline in this Quickstart looks like this:  \\n#### Before you Begin\\nBefore trying this example, ensure that you have:\\n  * A GitHub account. This is required for forking the sample repository.\\n  * A JFrog Platform account, or self-hosted JFrog Pipelines.\\n  * At least one node pool. This is the set of nodes that all pipeline steps will execute in. For more information, see Managing Pipelines Node Pools. Please note that if you have a Cloud account, a node pool will already be available as part of your subscription.\\n  * It is recommended that you run `go mod tidy` command on your local machine to produce the `go.sum` file and then push it to your Git repo.\\n\\n\\n#### Running This Example\\nPlease follow the steps below to build your Go binary:\\n  1.  **Fork the repository**\\nThis Pipelines sample is available in the  jfrog-pipelines-go-sample repository in the JFrog GitHub account. The configuration is included in YAML files at the root of the repository:\\n    * `pipelines.yml`, which contains the declarations for all the resources and steps required to run the pipeline. This configuration is written in template format, so you will not need to change anything in this file.\\n    * `values.yml`, which contains custom values that will be populated into the template to create your pipeline\\nFork this repository to your account or organization. This is important since you need admin access to repositories that are used as in your pipelines, in order to enable us to add webhooks to these repositories and listen for change events.\\n### Note\\nThe Git repository includes a `go.sum` file. However, it is recommended that you run `go mod tidy` command on your local machine to produce a new `go.sum` file and then push it to your Git repo.\\n  2.  **Sign in to Artifactory**\\nSign in to JFrog Platform with your Artifactory credentials.\\n  3.  **Create the required Go repositories**\\nYou will need to create the following repositories which will be used in your pipeline configuration:\\n    1. go-local: A local Go repository where your binary will be publishedGo Registry\\n    2. go-remote: A remote Go repository that proxies https://proxy.golang.org/Go Registry\\n    3. go-virtual: A virtual Go repository that aggregates local and remote repositories and is used in your pipeline definition to resolve dependencies. Please ensure that you select your local and remote repositories in the **Repositories** section while creating this virtual repo.Go Registry\\n  4.  **Add Integrations**\\n    1. Go to **Administration** **| Pipelines | Integrations** to  add two integrations:\\n      *  **GitHub Integration**: This integration is used to add the Pipeline source, as well as the GitRepo resource.\\n      *  **Artifactory Integration** : This integration is used to authenticate with Artifactory to resolve depedencies and to publish the built binary to Artifactory.\\n    2. Write down the names of both GitHub and Artifactory integrations as these are required for the next step . Ensure that the names are unique and easy to remember.\\n  5.  **Update pipeline definitions**\\nSince your `pipelines.yml` config file is templatized, you can just update `values.yml` in your forked repository by following instructions below.\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`gitProvider`\\nProvide the name of the Github integration you added in the previous step (4).\\n`gitProvider: myGithubIntegration`  \\n`repoPath`\\nProvide the path to your fork of this repository.\\n`repoPath: myuser/jfrog-pipelines-maven-sample`  \\n`artifactory`\\nProvide the name of the Artifactory integration you added in the previous step (4).\\n`artifactory: myArtifactoryIntegration`  \\nAnd that's it. Your configuration is ready to go!\\n### Note\\n **All pipeline definitions are global across JFrog Pipelines within a Project.** The names of your pipelines and resources need to be unique within the Project in JFrog Pipelines.\\n  6.  **Add Pipeline Sources**\\nA Pipeline Source represents the git repository where our pipelines definition files are stored. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an  integration, which we added in step 4.\\n    1. In your left navigation bar, go to **Administration |** **Pipelines | Pipeline Sources**. Click on **Add a Pipeline Source** and then choose **From YAML**. Follow instructions to add a Pipeline Source. This automatically adds your configuration to the platform and pipelines are created based on your YAML.\\n    2. After your pipeline source syncs successfully, navigate to **Pipelines | My Pipelines** in the left navbar to view the newly added pipeline. In this example, `go_build_pipeline_example` is the names of your pipeline.\\n    3. Click the name of the pipeline. This renders a real-time, interactive, diagram of the pipeline and the results of its most current run.\\n  7.  **Execute the Pipeline**\\nYou can trigger the pipeline by committing a change to your repository, or by manually triggering it through the UI.  \\n  8.  **Success!**\\nYou have successfully executed the sample go application pipeline! You can verify the results by viewing the binary and build created by the pipeline.\\nNavigate to **Application | Artifactory | Artifacts** and you will find your published binary under the **go-local** repository:  \\nNavigate to **Application | Artifactory | Builds** to view your published `build -` `go_build_pipeline_example`.  \\n\\n\\n#### Explanation of pipeline definition\\nLet us now take a look at the pipeline definition files and what each section means.\\nThe **pipelines.yml** file contains the templatized definition of your pipeline. This consists of the following:\\n  * Resources are entities that contain information that is consumed or generated by pipeline steps. In our example, we use the following resources:\\n    * A GitRepo resource pointing to the source control repository where your application code is present. You can configure this resource to trigger dependent steps on specific events.\\n    * A BuildInfo resource that is a pointer to the Build on Artifactory. This is automatically created by the PublishBuildInfo step.\\n  * Steps are executable units that form your pipeline. In our example, the pipeline consists of the following steps:\\n    * A GoBuild native step that builds your Go project. This step is a pre-packaged step (i.e. native step) that is available to use with simple configuration and without the need for custom scripting. Detailed information on GoBuild is available here.\\n    * A GoPublishBinary native step that publishes your Go binary to Artifactory. This step also does not need custom scripting. Detailed information on GoPublishBinary is available here\\n    * A PublishBuildInfo step is a native step that gathers build metadata and pushes it to Artifactory. Artifactory Builds provide a manifest and include metadata about included modules, dependencies and other environment variables. Detailed information on PublishBuildInfo is available here.\\n\\n\\n\\n Document url for reference - https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-pipelines-documentation/pipelines-steps</s>\n",

Helps user to write jFrog pipline and answers about jFrog pipline process <</SYS>> Write a jFrog pipeline to do a pipeline-example-npm-build?[/INST] This pipeline demonstrates the definition of a simple pipeline that builds and publishes an npm package. An example Pipelines DSL is used to show how to use integrations, resources, and steps to construct a simple, automated workflow.\\nThis example shows the following:\\n  * Create a GitHub Integration and Artifactory Integration.GitHub Integration\\n  * Add a Pipeline Source.\\n  * Build npm components using the NpmBuild native step.\\n  * Publish the npm component using the NpmPublish native step.\\n\\n\\n### See it Live!\\nClick here to see this quickstart in action.\\nA successful run of the pipeline in this quickstart looks like this:  \\n#### Before you Begin\\nBefore trying this quickstart, ensure that you have:\\n  * A GitHub account. This is required for forking the example repository.\\n  * A JFrog Platform account, or self-hosted JFrog Pipelines.\\n  * Set up Artifactory as an npm Registry. Create three repositories:npm Registry\\n    * A  remote npm registry. Remote Repositories defined in Artifactory serve as a caching proxy for a registry managed at a remote URL such as `https://registry.npmjs.org`. Artifacts (such as TGZ files) requested from a remote repository are cached on demand.npm RegistryRemote Repositories\\n    * A local npm registry.\\n    * A  virtual npm registry. A Virtual Repository defined in Artifactory aggregates packages from both local and remote repositories. This allows you to access both locally hosted npm packages and remote proxied npm registries from a single URL defined for the virtual repository.npm Registry\\nWhen adding the virtual npm registry, ensure that both the remote and local npm registries are selected, and the Default Deployment Repository is set to the local npm registry.  \\n  * At least one node pool. This is the set of nodes that all pipeline steps will execute in. For more information, see Managing Pipelines Node Pools.\\n\\n\\n#### Running This Example\\nPerform the steps below to build and push your npm image:\\n  1. ##### Fork the repository\\nThe Pipelines DSL for this example is available in the npm-example repository in the JFrog GitHub account.\\nThe DSL file is a yaml file that contains the pipeline definitions. This example uses two yaml files:\\n    * `pipelines.yml`, which contains the declarations for all the resources and workflow steps required to run the pipeline.\\n    * `values.yml`, which contains the values required for the pipelines.yml file.\\nFor a full breakup of all the resources, pipelines and steps used in the yml file, see the pipelines.yml section below.\\nFork this repository to your account or organization. This is important since you need admin access to repositories that are used as Pipeline Sources or GitRepo resources, in order to add webhooks to these repositories and listen for change events.\\n  2. ##### Sign in to Artifactory\\nSign in to JFrog Platform with your Artifactory credentials.\\n  3. ##### Add Integrations\\na. Go to **Administration** **| Pipelines | Integrations** to  add two integrations:\\n    *  **GitHub Integration**: This integration is used to add the Pipeline source, as well as the GitRepo resource defined in  values.yml.\\n    *  **Artifactory Integration** : This integration is used to authenticate with Artifactory to download npm depedencies from Artifactory, and to pack and upload the built package to Artifactory.\\nb. Write down the names of both GitHub and Artifactory integrations as these are required for the next step. Ensure that the names are unique and easy to remember.\\n  4. ##### Update values.yml and pipelines.yml\\nThe pipelines configuration is available in the `values.yml` file. Edit this file in your fork of this repo and replace the following:\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`gitProvider`\\nProvide the name of the Github integration you added in the previous step.\\n`gitProvider: my_github`  \\n`path`\\nProvide the path to your fork of this repository.\\n`path: myuser/project-examples`  \\nEdit the` pipelines.yml` file and replace the following:\\nTag\\nDescription\\nExample  \\n`sourceArtifactory`\\nProvide your Artifactory integration.\\n`sourceArtifactory: art`  \\n`repositoryName`\\nProvide the name of the npm repository in Artifactory.\\n`repositoryName: npm-virtual`  \\n### Note\\n **All pipeline definitions are global across JFrog Pipelines within a Project.** The names of your pipelines and resources need to be unique within the Project in JFrog Pipelines.\\n  5. ##### Add Pipeline Sources\\nThe **Pipeline Source** represents the git repository where our pipelines definition files are stored. A pipeline source connects to the repository through an integration, which we added in step 3.\\nIn your left navigation bar, go to **Administration |** **Pipelines | Pipeline Sources**. Click on **Add a Pipeline Source** and then choose **From YAML**. Follow instructions to add a Pipeline Source. This automatically adds your configuration to the platform and pipelines are created based on your YAML.\\n  6. ##### Execute the Pipeline\\nAfter your Pipeline Source is synced successfully, navigate to **Pipelines | My Pipelines** in the left navbar to see the newly added pipeline. In this example, `npm_example_pipeline_jfp` is the name of our pipeline. Click the name of the pipeline. This renders a real-time, interactive, diagram of the pipeline and the results of its most current run.  \\nYou can trigger the pipeline by committing a change to your repository, or by manually triggering it through the UI. The steps in the pipeline execute in sequence. Multiple steps can execute in parallel if the node pool has multiple build nodes available.  \\nOnce the pipeline has completed, a new run is listed.  \\n\\n\\n#### pipelines.yml\\nThe `pipelines.yml` file is made up of resources, pipelines and steps, as shown below:\\n##### Resources\\nThis example uses the following types of resources:\\n  * GitRepo\\n  * BuildInfo\\n\\n\\n **GitRepo**\\nA GitRepo resource is used to connect JFrog Pipelines to a source control repository. Adding it creates a webhook to the repo so that future commits will automatically create a new version with the webhook payload.\\n **resources**\\n[YAML]\\n      - name: npm_example_repo_jfp\\n        type: GitRepo\\n        configuration:\\n          # SCM integration where the repository is located\\n          gitProvider: {{ .Values.myRepo.gitProvider }}\\n          # Repository path, including org name/repo name\\n          path: {{ .Values.myRepo.path }}\\n          branches:\\n            # Specifies which branches will trigger dependent steps\\n            include: master\\n[/YAML]\\nTag\\n **Description**\\nRequired/Optional  \\nname\\n`npm_example_repo_jfp` is the name of the GitRepo resource pointing to the repository containing the yaml files and other source code required to build the image.\\nThis name is used to refer to the resource in steps, and must be unique across all repositories in your JFrog Pipelines environment.\\nRequired  \\n`gitProvider `\\nThe name of the GitHub Integration.
